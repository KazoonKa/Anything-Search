# Q : What is this?
A : This is a simple search engine made for quick and flawless search. It offers a minimalistic look and purpose.

# Q : Why is it made?
A : Originally at school, there's a dream technology thing and the theme is future. So I thought of an app that could search from any other search engine, but all my friends thought of flying cars and more fantasy-like things. So I started designing the concept at canva and I of course named it "Anything", showed everyone the concept, the teacher liked it. Then 1 year later I learnt HTML and i knew I could recreate this app, so i started making it. Now we got this Anything Search thing.
